## Sample Gemini AI projects using FB4D 

You need to download the [FB4D project](https://github.com/SchneiderInfosystems/FB4D) before testing these examples.

Create a FB4D environment variable in delphi with the full path to the directory where FB4D is located.

Get a Gemini API key from [https://ai.google.dev/](https://ai.google.dev/) and add it to the uConstantes.inc file.
